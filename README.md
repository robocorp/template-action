# Template: Python - Actions

This template gets you started in creating Actions for [Robocorp Action Server](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/tree/master/action_server/docs#readme).

`Actions` and `Action Server` enable you to "give your AI Agents hands" meaning that your AI/LLM Agent can help your users perform distinct actions that get executed based on the LLM discussion.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install Robocorp Action Server
On macOS
```sh
brew update
brew install robocorp/tools/action-server 
```

On Windows and Linux:

1. [Download the executable](https://downloads.robocorp.com/action-server/releases/index.html)
   - Linux: `chmod a+x action-server`
2. Add the executable in `PATH` 
   - Windows: `setx PATH "%PATH%;%CD%"`
   - Linux: `sudo mv action-server /usr/local/bin/`

> Robocorp Action Server is also available via `pip install robocorp-action-server`

### 2. Bootstrap your first Action

```sh
# Bootstrap a new project using this template.
action-server new

# You'll be prompted for the name of the project (directory):

# Start Action Server 
cd my-project
action-server start --expose
```

Once thatâ€™s done, youâ€™ll have an Action Server UI locally (by default at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)) and a public internet-facing URL (something like "https://twently-cuddly-dinosaurs.robocorp.link").

ðŸš€ `Robocorp Action Server` is in developer preview so expect a bunch of updates in the near future both to the tooling as well as templates, examples and documentation.

## Dependency management

Action Server uses [./conda.yaml](conda.yaml) file serving as the configuration file for managing the environment in which your actions run. It specifies the dependencies and packages required, ensuring that each run happens in a clean and repeatable environment.

> Q: "Why not just `pip install...`?"<br/>
> A: As you'll probably not run the Action on your machine forever, you will need to control your Python dependencies and the Python version itself. Using the [conda.yaml](conda.yaml) allows you to get everything repeatable and nicely isolated without hassle.

To add a new dependency, simply add them to the pip section of the [conda.yaml](conda.yaml) dependencies:

```yaml
channels:
  - conda-forge

dependencies:
  - python=3.10.12
  - pip=23.2.1
  - robocorp-truststore=0.8.0
  - pip:
      - robocorp==1.4.0
      - robocorp-actions==0.0.4
      - pytz==2023.3
```
ðŸ‘‰ You also have all the tools and packages from [conda-forge](https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge) available in the `dependencies` -section.. not just Python.

## Actions in VS Code 

ðŸ‘‰ Using [Robocorp Code extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robocorp.robocorp-code), you can get everything set up and running in VS Code in no time.

The template has a few files that enable the extension to find and set up your action environment and provide code completion. There is also a side panel where we have and will add some easy-to-use functionalities.

When debugging your Actions Python code, you probably do not want to give the inputs every time you run and always be running the Action Server, so you can set your test inputs in a [input.json](./devdata/input.json) and just run/debug your Python code.


## What does the template Action do?

The template is a simple starting point to show how to get started.

The action enables you to get the timezone differences between locations.

We use [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) as an example to show that you can leverage the whole Python ecosystem. Robocorp provides [a bunch of libraries](https://pypi.org/search/?q=robocorp-); you can make your own. The sky is the limit.

ðŸš€ Now, go get'em
